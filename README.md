# Advent of Code 2023

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding event with daily programming challenges throughout the month of December. This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023. I've attempted to solve each problem independently, but for some challenges, I struggled to understand or approach them despite watching explanations from others. Consequently, I haven't uploaded solutions for those particular problems.
