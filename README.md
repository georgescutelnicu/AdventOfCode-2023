# Advent of Code 2023

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual coding event featuring daily programming challenges throughout December. This repository contains my solutions to the 2023 challenges. While I tried to solve each problem on my own, i encountered more difficulties as the event unfolded. In such instances i watched explanations and solutions from others participants to get a better understanding on how to approach them. As a result, not all the problems have a solution included in this repository.
